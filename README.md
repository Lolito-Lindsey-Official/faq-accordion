## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- JavaScript (a mix DOM manipulation and function parameters)

### Continued Improvement

I plan on continuing to improve my DOM manipulation skills as it is interesting to me. It fired up new project ideas (like a feelings check-up app and a user greeting app) when I went through the process.
